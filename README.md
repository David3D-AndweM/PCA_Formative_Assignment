**Student**: David Mwape  
**Course**: Advanced Linear Algebra  
**Assignment**: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) Implementation  
**Dataset**: African Import/Export Trade Data  

## 📋 Assignment Overview

This assignment demonstrates the implementation of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) from scratch using advanced linear algebra concepts. I worked with real African trade data to show how PCA can reduce dimensionality while preserving important information in the dataset.

### 🎯 What is PCA?
Principal Component Analysis is a statistical technique that:
- Reduces the number of features in a dataset
- Finds the directions (principal components) that explain the most variance
- Helps visualize high-dimensional data in lower dimensions
- Removes redundancy and noise from data

## 📊 Dataset: African Import/Export Trade Data

### 🇿🇲 Personal Connection - Why I Chose This Data
**As a Zambian student**, I have a deep personal connection to this dataset. Growing up in Zambia, I have witnessed firsthand how international trade impacts our economy - from copper exports that drive our GDP to agricultural products that support rural communities. This dataset is not just academic exercise for me; it represents the economic reality of my home country and region.

**Why this matters to me personally:**
- 🏠 **Home Country Impact**: This data includes trade from Zambia and neighboring countries
- 📈 **Economic Understanding**: Helps me analyze patterns affecting my community
- 🎓 **Academic Passion**: Combines my technical skills with knowledge of African economics
- 🌍 **Regional Development**: Understanding SADC trade relationships and their impact
- 💼 **Career Relevance**: As a future data scientist, African economic data analysis is crucial

This dataset choice reflects both academic rigor and personal passion for African development.

### About the Data
I used authentic African Import/Export Trade Data with the following characteristics:
- **Source**: Real trade transactions from African countries
- **Size**: 22 rows × 34 columns (well above the required 10+ columns)
- **Type**: Mixed data with both numerical and categorical features
- **Content**: Import/export transactions, company information, trade values, customs data

### Why This Dataset?
- ✅ **Africanized Data**: Authentic African trade information (not generic datasets)
- ✅ **Real-world Relevance**: Actual economic data showing trade relationships
- ✅ **Complex Structure**: Mix of categorical and numerical data perfect for PCA
- ✅ **Meaningful Analysis**: Can reveal trade patterns and economic relationships

### Data Features Include:
- **Company Information**: Exporter/Importer names, declarant details
- **Geographic Data**: Origin/destination countries, ports of entry
- **Product Details**: HS codes, product descriptions, quantities
- **Financial Data**: Customs values, invoice amounts, freight costs
- **Logistics**: Package types, weights, shipping details
- **Administrative**: Declaration offices, regime types, dates


## 🚀 Implementation Steps - What I Did

### Step 1: Data Preparation and Cleaning
**Challenge**: The dataset had 18 categorical columns that needed to be converted to numbers for PCA.

**My Solution**:
```python
# Created a custom label encoder (no sklearn allowed!)
class CustomLabelEncoder:
    def __init__(self):
        self.label_mapping = {}
        self.reverse_mapping = {}
    
    def fit_transform(self, data):
        unique_values = sorted(data.unique())
        self.label_mapping = {val: idx for idx, val in enumerate(unique_values)}
        return data.map(self.label_mapping)
```

**What this does**: Converts text data like "BOTSWANA" cat >> README.md << 'EOF'

## Implementation Steps - What I Did

### Step 1: Data Preparation and Cleaning
**Challenge**: The dataset had 18 categorical columns that needed to be converted to numbers for PCA.

**My Solution**: Created a custom label encoder (no sklearn allowed!)
- Converts text data like "BOTSWANA" -> 0, "NAMIBIA" -> 1, etc.
- Result: All 34 features became numeric, ready for PCA analysis

### Step 2: Custom PCA Implementation (Task 1)
**Challenge**: Implement PCA from scratch without using sklearn.

**My 5-Step Process**:
1. **Center the data**: Subtract the mean from each feature
2. **Calculate covariance matrix**: Shows how features relate to each other
3. **Find eigenvalues and eigenvectors**: These are the "principal components"
4. **Sort by importance**: Largest eigenvalues explain most variance
5. **Transform data**: Project original data onto principal components

**Key Finding**: PC1 explains 100% of the variance! One component captures all important information.

### Step 3: Dynamic Component Selection (Task 2)
**Challenge**: Automatically choose how many components to keep based on variance.

**My Solution**: Created a function that selects components based on variance thresholds:
- For 80% variance: Need 1 component
- For 90% variance: Need 1 component  
- For 95% variance: Need 1 component
- For 99% variance: Need 1 component

**Result**: Achieved 97.1% dimensionality reduction (34 -> 1 features)


### Step 4: Performance Optimization (Task 3)
**Challenge**: Make PCA faster for large datasets.

**My Optimization Strategy**:
- Used SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) for wide matrices
- Memory-efficient covariance calculation
- Benchmarked performance between original and optimized versions

**Results**: Both implementations work correctly with identical results

### Step 5: Custom Matrix Library (Required by Rubric)
**Challenge**: Create matrix operations without external libraries.

**What I Built**:
```python
class CustomMatrix:
    def add(self, other)          # Matrix addition
    def subtract(self, other)     # Matrix subtraction  
    def multiply(self, other)     # Matrix multiplication
    def transpose(self)           # Matrix transpose
    def shape(self)              # Get dimensions
```

**Features**:
- Handles different matrix dimensions
- Comprehensive error handling
- No external Python libraries used
- Works with matrices of any size

### Step 6: Visualizations
**What I Created**:
1. **Before PCA Plot**: Original feature space (Feature 1 vs Feature 2)
2. **After PCA Plot**: Principal component space (PC1 vs PC2)
3. **Explained Variance Chart**: Shows importance of each component

**Key Insight**: The visualizations show how PCA rotates and centers the data to find the best representation.
